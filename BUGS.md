# KNOWN BUGS

- Copy/paste from/to clipboard doesn't work when the program is called from a tmux shell (for both SWT and JavaFX)
- The formatting of XML Transformer has changed in Java9 and it's a mess... See http://java9.wtf/xml-transformer/ for more explanations. It may be the time to considere replacing DOM by SAX.
